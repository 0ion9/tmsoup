# Simple repair of tmsu database by filename:
#  * Ask TMSU to list missing paths (`tmsu repair`)
#  * For each path, look for paths with exact same basename, searching recursively within current directory
#   * if there was exactly one match, use `tmsu repair --manual` to repair it.
#    * if the new path of the file is already tagged, this will fail. In that case we use 
#      `tmsu-fs-merge` to merge the original path's tags onto the current path.
#   * if there were 0, or more than 1 matches, report them, but do not attempt to repair
